# Archive Review (Phase 2 Review UI) — Project Reference

Built 2026-07-07 from `../handoff-phase2-review-ui.md` — read that for intent,
this file for what actually shipped and how it works.

## What it is

A local web app (Vite + React) that opens Google Drive folders produced by the
mobile app (`../archive-capture/`) or the batch uploader (`../batch-uploader/`)
and turns them into a review/organize/file interface. Two modes:

- **Marking Mode** — PDF viewer (pdf.js) with pen/highlighter markup + undo,
  editable metadata, per-collection tags with master-pool autocomplete,
  attributed comments/OMG flags, generated citations (footnote + bibliography,
  with explicit `[box?]`-style placeholders when fields are missing).
- **Filing Mode** — drag-to-merge card table: files merge into multi-page
  documents, documents into Folders, Folders into Boxes (iOS-folder-style
  animation + WebAudio chime; invalid merges shake + low buzz). Everything is
  local + undoable until an explicit Save writes real structure to Drive.

Two data backends behind one interface (`src/lib/backend.js`):
- **DriveBackend** — real Drive REST calls (port of batch-uploader's drive.js).
- **DemoBackend** — the "sample archive": an in-memory corpus with both tree
  shapes and real generated PDFs (`src/lib/demoData.js` + `demoPdf.js`), so
  every feature is exercisable with zero Google setup. All app code above the
  backend is identical in both modes.

## Run it

```
wsl.exe -e bash -lc "cd ~/projects/Organizer_Archives/review-ui && npm run dev"
```
then http://localhost:5173. Port 5173 is pinned (`strictPort`) because it's the
OAuth client's only authorized local origin. There is also a `review-ui` entry
in `../.claude/launch.json`.

## One-time setup still needed for real Drive mode

Sample mode works immediately. Real mode needs (instructions also at the top
of `src/config.js`):
1. **Picker API key** — Cloud project `526107030062`: enable "Google Picker
   API", create an API key, paste into `PICKER_API_KEY` in `src/config.js`.
   The "Sign in with Google" button stays disabled (with a note) until then.
2. OAuth reuses the batch uploader's web client ID (localhost:5173 already
   authorized) — any user must be an OAuth **test user** on the consent screen
   (Hannah + Justina already are).
3. Scopes: `drive.file` + `userinfo.profile/email` (profile is new vs. the
   uploader — used to attribute comments/tags; users will see a re-consent).
   `drive.file` visibility is per-Cloud-project, so files created by the
   mobile app / uploader (same project) are readable here; the Picker grants
   access to anything else the user explicitly picks.

## Schema additions (beyond ../archive-capture/docs/metadata-schema.md)

This tool reads/writes the mobile app's `properties` schema unchanged, plus
(see `src/lib/metadata.js`):
- `comment_log` — JSON `[{page,text,user,ts}]`; `typed_comments` is kept in
  sync (same entries minus attribution) so mobile-app conventions still hold.
- `tag_log` — JSON `[{tag,user,ts}]`; `omg_log` — JSON `[{page,user,ts}]`.
- `title` — free-text File Title (used in citations, display names).
- `notes_page_index` — where the human-readable Notes page sits in the PDF.
  The Notes page (attributed comments/tags/OMG rendered as text) is rebuilt on
  every save, inserted after content pages, before backup pages.

Known constraint inherited from the schema: Drive property values cap at ~124
bytes — long comment logs can exceed this. The mobile app has the same
unguarded issue; punted here on purpose (first pass, matches existing risk).

## Conventions honored (do not re-derive)

- Filename: `Archive <n> - Collection <n> - Box <n> - Folder <n> - NNNNNN[ - OMG].pdf`,
  missing fields skipped, six-digit counter per Box+Folder scope starting after
  what's already in the destination folder (`src/lib/naming.js`).
- Markup bake = mobile-app convention: marked page gets a yellow warning
  banner, clean original appended at the PDF's back, `unmarked_backup_pages`
  updated (`src/lib/markupBake.js`). Strokes are recorded in PDF-point
  coordinates directly (viewer wrapper matches page aspect exactly, so there
  is no letterbox offset to correct — the web analogue of MarkupScreen's
  computeContentRect fix).
- Filing save (`src/lib/mergeSave.js`): merged docs = content pages of each
  source in order (backups re-appended + re-indexed, notes page rebuilt), tags
  union, page-indexed fields offset per source, earliest `captured_at`,
  sources trashed. Single files are filed in place (props + rename + move, no
  re-upload). Loose unmerged files are left untouched by Save.
- Highlight gradient: score = 3·OMG + 2·comments + 2·markup + tags, percentile
  ranked within collection (unfiled trees rank against their own root), tiers
  at >90 / >75 / ≥50th percentile, folders glow as their brightest descendant.

## Verified working (sample mode, 2026-07-07)

Full click-through: tree with both corpus shapes + tiered highlights + badges;
open/mark/undo/save with bake + notes rebuild; tag autocomplete from the
master pool; attributed comments; citations incl. incomplete placeholders;
filing drags file→doc→folder→box, multi-select merge (captured_at order),
undo/reset, invalid-merge rejection, Save produced
`Archive Capture — Good Poems/Folder 1/…000001-000003.pdf` with correct merged
PDFs and metadata; explorer drag-move; switch-folders.

**Not yet tested:** anything against real Drive (needs the Picker API key +
a real sign-in). The Drive code paths are direct ports of the batch uploader's
shipped calls plus standard PATCH endpoints, but expect a shakedown session.

## Where things are

- `src/App.jsx` — stage/mode state, corpus in a mutable Map + version counter
- `src/lib/corpus.js` — tree loading (BFS), highlight tier computation
- `src/components/PdfViewer.jsx` — render + zoom/pan/pinch/swipe + stroke capture
- `src/components/MarkingMode.jsx` — save pipeline (bake → notes → props)
- `src/components/FilingMode.jsx` — card workspace, pointer-drag merge, save modal
- `src/lib/mergeSave.js` — arrangement → real Drive structure
- `src/lib/tagStore.js` — per-collection pools + master pool (localStorage +
  derived from loaded files; the mobile app's AsyncStorage pools are
  unreachable from the web, so pools rebuild from what's actually on files)

## Git

Own repo (`main`), no remote yet. Same local identity as the sibling projects.
